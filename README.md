# Storm-Client Plugins
My free to use Storm-Client plugins
For suggestions or features/bugs contact Keegan#2181 on discord

# EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE: 
I test my plugins using Packets/Invoke as the interaction method. They often interact too quickly for the "Mouse Events" interaction method. If you're having any issues, make sure you're using Packets or Invoke.

# Current Plugins:
	* keegan-emotes - Allows binding of emotes to keys. 
		(Can only bind to Shift/CTRL/Alt currently)
	* keegan-fisher - 3T fly fishes at barbarian village, or barbarian fishing near barbarian outpost
		(Needs herb+swamp tar+pestle and mortar) 
	* keegan-miner - 3T mines iron ore at the Ardougne Mine, ~65-70k xp/hr, higher with varrock armor 
		(Needs herb+swamp tar+pestle and mortar) 
	* keegan-woodcut - 3T woodcuts  
		(Needs herb+swamp tar+pestle and mortar) 
  
# STABILITY:
	* keegan-emotes - It just does emotes... nothing to worry about here  
	* keegan-fisher - Has only been tested for a few hours, would babysit for a bit personally
	* keegan-miner - Should be very stable.
	* keegan-woodcut - Has only been tested for a few hours at Barbarian Outpost willows, would babysit for a bit personally
	
# Configuration:
	* keegan-emotes - Type the name of any emote  
	* Fisher/Miner/Woodcutter - "Hop Worlds" toggle will world hop if another player is near by. (Must launch client with user/password arguments for this to work, otherwise it will logout and wait for you to manually log back in) 
	* Debug - Will log some debugging information if enabled (Generally best to just leave it disabled)
