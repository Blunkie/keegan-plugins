# Storm-Client Plugins
My free to use Storm-Client plugins
For suggestions or features/bugs contact Keegan#2181 on discord

# EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE: 
I test my plugins using Packets/Invoke as the interaction method. They often interact too quickly for the "Mouse Events" interaction method. If you're having any issues, make sure you're using Packets or Invoke.

# Current Plugins:
	* keegan-emotes - Allows binding of emotes to keys. 
		(Can only bind to Shift/CTRL/Alt currently)
	* keegan-fisher - 3T fly fishes at barbarian village, or barbarian fishing near barbarian outpost
		(Needs herb+swamp tar+pestle and mortar) 
	* keegan-miner - 3T mines iron ore at the Ardougne Mine, ~65-70k xp/hr, higher with varrock armor 
		(Needs herb+swamp tar+pestle and mortar) 
	* keegan-woodcut - 3T woodcuts  
		(Needs herb+swamp tar+pestle and mortar) 
	* keegan-altar - 1 Ticks any bones at chaos altar in the wilderness, and unnotes them at the NPC. START IT AT THE ALTAR. 
		Will log out and change worlds to avoid PKers. You need to launch the client with user/password arguments 
		for the plugin to be able to log back in.
  
# STABILITY:
	* keegan-emotes - It just does emotes... nothing to worry about here  
	* keegan-fisher - Has only been tested for a few hours, would babysit for a bit personally
	* keegan-miner - Should be very stable.
	* keegan-woodcut - Has only been tested for a few hours at Barbarian Outpost willows, would babysit for a bit personally
	* keegan-altar - I generally just run this to knock out 1-43 real quick, but haven't had any issues. It is TECHNICALLY
			 possible to be PKed so I wouldn't bring like 10k dragon bones or anything, but it's unlikely. 
	
# Configuration:
	* keegan-emotes - Type the name of any emote  
	* Fisher/Miner/Woodcutter - "Hop Worlds" toggle will world hop if another player is near by. (Must launch client with user/password arguments for this to work, otherwise it will logout and wait for you to manually log back in) 
	* Debug - Will log some debugging information if enabled (Generally best to just leave it disabled)
